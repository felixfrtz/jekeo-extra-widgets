# JEKEO Extra Widgets

Extra custom coded Widgets for the Jekeo WordPress Theme.

## Getting Started

Because I think there are some widgets missing, I will be adding some here which I am using for my install.

### Installing

You can put the folders from /widgets/ in your /widgets/ folder in your theme. Ideally, a child theme should be used.
